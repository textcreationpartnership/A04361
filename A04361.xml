         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE cau≈øe of the en≈øuing ≈øo ≈øtrange and cruell Martyrdomes, ≈øuch as were neuer heard of in the Kingdom of <hi>Iaponia,</hi> ≈øince the Per≈øecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Chri≈øtians there began, was this as followeth.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Emperour of <hi>Iaponia</hi> ≈øome yeares pa≈øt, had forbidden, by Proclamation throughout all the Prouinces of that Kingdome, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> paine of death, that no Sayler or Mariner ≈øhould bring any Chri≈øtian Religious man into <hi>Iaponia;</hi> which was a thing very ea≈øy to be done, in regard that <hi>Manila</hi> the chiefe Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Philippine</hi> Ilands is ≈øo neare, and where there is ≈øo great trafficke betweene the <hi>Spanyards</hi> and <hi>Iapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians:</hi> Notwith≈øtanding ≈øome there were both Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, and Catholike Marriners, who ≈øtyrred vp with zeale of Gods Honour, not regarding the threats and penaltyes of the lawes, did bring at ≈øundry tymes from <hi>Manila</hi> into <hi>Iaponia,</hi> many Religious men, in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6944:3"/> ≈øecular apparell, to cultiuate and manure that new-planted Vineyard of this new-found Chri≈øtendome.</p>
            <p>Among≈øt the ≈øayd Marriners there was one more famous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the re≈øt, Captayne of a ≈øhip, called <hi>Ioachim,</hi> who as he ≈øayled from <hi>Manila</hi> towards <hi>Iaponia,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him two very Reuerend Religious men, the one wherof was called Father <hi>Pedro de Zuniga</hi> of the Order of <hi>S. Au≈øten,</hi> and the other, Father <hi>Lewis de Flores</hi> of the Order of <hi>S. Dominicke,</hi> whome he could not tran≈øport ≈øo ≈øecretly, but they were betrayed by certayne <hi>Hollande s,</hi> who euen vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the very ≈øhoare of <hi>Iaponia,</hi> inuaded and robbed <hi>Ioachims</hi> ≈øhip, and al≈øo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øed him before the Emperours Officers, for brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the ≈øayd Religious men with him into <hi>Iaponia,</hi> contrary to the Emperours Proclamation: And for this cau≈øe was <hi>Ioachim</hi> pre≈øently ca≈øt into pri≈øon at <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum,</hi> togeather with the ≈øayd two Fathers, and all the other Marriners that were Chri≈øtians.</p>
            <p>There was at that tyme in the ≈øame Citty re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding another Religious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of the order of <hi>S. Dominick</hi> who went about to deliuer the fore≈øayd Father <hi>Lewis</hi> out of pri≈øon; which indeed he had almo≈øt effected, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with the deliuery of many more Chri≈øtians that were in the ≈øame Pri≈øon; but becau≈øe he could not breake open the pri≈øon doores without great noy≈øe, nor bring to pa≈ø≈øe what he had determined, with that ≈øecrecy he de≈øired, his plot was ≈øoone di≈øcouered, and all the Pri≈øoners brought backe againe into pri≈øon.</p>
            <p>When the Emperour heard of this, he tooke the matter ≈øo heynou≈øly, and was ≈øo inraged again≈øt the Chri≈øtians, a≈øwell in regard of the new comming of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6944:3"/> tho≈øe Religious men into his Kingdome, to preach the Chri≈øtian fayth, as al≈øo, becau≈øe they had broken his Maie≈øties pri≈øon; that without delay, he comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Gouernour of <hi>Nanga≈øachi</hi> pre≈øe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tly to repayre to <hi>Firandum,</hi> and there put to death fir≈øt of all <hi>Ioachim</hi> the Captayne, and afterwards the two Religious men that he brought with him, as al≈øo all the other Marriners, that were Chri≈øtians. Moreouer he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that all other Religious men, whether they were of <hi>Europe,</hi> or of <hi>Iaponia</hi> who were impri≈øoned in diuers Cittyes ≈øhould be put to death. And the like pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment he charged to be inflicted vpon all Widows, and Orphanes, who≈øe Husbands, or Parents had in the former Per≈øecution of late yeares, ≈øuffered death for the fayth of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>The Gouernour with all ≈øpeed, at the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours commaundment, came to <hi>Firandum,</hi> where cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for the pri≈øoners, he began to examine and aske them many que≈øtions; as, whether they were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians? From whence they came? Of what Nation they were? And when, and where they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? Nor he did forget, now and then to exhort them to renounce their Fayth, promi≈øing them their liues, if they would ≈øo do; &amp; affirming that he had full power and Commi≈ø≈øio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> from the Emperour, for what he promi≈øed.</p>
            <p>But to this la≈øt, one and the ≈øelfe ≈øame mo≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant Reply was made by all; That nothing in the world ≈øhould cau≈øe them deny their fayth, nor breake the promi≈øe they had made to IESVS CHRIST in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme. Vpon which an≈øwere and firme re≈øolution, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6944:4"/> Gouernour pre≈øently pronounced ≈øentence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Captayne <hi>Ioachim,</hi> and the two Religious Fathers <hi>Pedro de Zuniga</hi> the <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> Friar, and Father <hi>Lewis de Flores</hi> the Dominican, to be burned aliue, &amp; the re≈øt of the Marriners, who were twelue in number, to be beheaded.</p>
            <p>Now the≈øe holy Confe≈ø≈øours of IESVS CHRIST hauing receaued this doom, the more to increa≈øe their ioy and a≈ø≈øurance of dying for Chri≈øts ≈øake, demanded of the Gouernour, for what cau≈øe he adiudged them to death? And they receiued this an≈øwere in very plaine tearmes: to wit, that the Religious men mu≈øt dye, becau≈øe they had again≈øt the Emperours decree, entred into <hi>Iaponia</hi> to preach the law of Chri≈øt; and the re≈øt for that they had brought the ≈øaid Preachers into the Countrey to that end. Which plaine declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was an exceeding ioy and Iubily of heart vnto them all, when they ≈øaw them≈øelues condemned to death for the fayth, and loue of IESVS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>The place appointed for the execution, was out of the Citty of <hi>Firandum,</hi> where there was a faire and large plot of ground, like vnto an Amphitheater, all inclo≈øed round with woodden rayles. Hither were the holy Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fe≈ø≈øours brought forth of the Citty, with infinite multitudes of people, and the three foremo≈øt placed ech one at a pillar, or ≈øtake, whereunto they were bound, with great aboundance of fagots, and wood layd round about them. But before the fire was kindled, the other twelue Marriners heads were ≈øtroke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> off within the fore≈øaid place, before the eyes of the Holy Confe≈ø≈øours, that ≈øtood now ready at the ≈øtake
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6944:4"/> to be burned.</p>
            <p>Heere now the good Captayne <hi>Ioachim</hi> made knowne the force of Chri≈øtian Eloquence, being not only permitted, but al≈øo commanded by the ≈øayd two Religious Fathers his Companions (who by rea≈øon of the ≈øhort tyme of their abode in <hi>Iaponia,</hi> had not yet learned the language of that countrey) to profe≈ø≈øe the fayth of Chri≈øt in the name of all the re≈øt. Of whome, ≈øuch as did both ≈øee and heare him, do affirme, that he ≈øeemed rather to ≈øpeake like an Apo≈øtle, then an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Preacher, much le≈ø≈øe a poore Marriner; ≈øuch was the feruour, ≈øuch the courage wherewith he preached IESVS CHRIST, in the very midde≈øt of the fyre and ≈ømoke. And by how much more the barbarous Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils endeauoured a≈øwell by often interrupting him, as by threats, to make him hold his peace; ≈øo much the more did he cry out, and ≈øay, that it was meet he ≈øhould rather obey God then Man. Neyther, can I be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (≈øayd he) by your threatninges: for what more cruell, or more grieuous torment can you deui≈øe, then that which I now indure in burning heere aliue? And this he ≈øaid out of the midde≈øt of the burning fire, as if it had bene out of a flaming pulpit, with an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble feruour of ≈øpirit, being indeed inflamed with the loue of IESVS CHRIST. Nor did he leaue darting out ≈øuch fiery words, vntill him≈øelfe, togeather with his two mo≈øt ble≈ø≈øed Companions, with wonderfull con≈øtancy ended their liues, and that in ≈øo quiet a manner, as if they had been altogeather immoueable, and wrapt in heauenly contemplation.</p>
            <p>This fir≈øt Pageant was repre≈øented vpon the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6944:5"/> one and twentith day of Augu≈øt, in the yeare of our Lord 1622. in pre≈øence of an infinite number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, who by continuall acclamations and crying out, and calling vpon God to a≈ø≈øi≈øt them, endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all meanes po≈ø≈øible to encourage the holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs to ≈øuffer death patiently, for the loue of IESVS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>The Executioners, as ≈øoone as they perceyued that the Martyrs were dead, went, and expo≈øed the heads of tho≈øe which they had fir≈øt ≈øtroken of, vpon a very high Table, to the greater feare, and terrour of all that ≈øhould behold them.

            <p>The concour≈øe of the people that came thither both night and day to wor≈øhip tho≈øe Holy Reliques, was wonderfull; notwith≈øtanding the many and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous blowes, yea and wounds which they receyued of the ≈øouldiers who were commanded there to watch, that no Chri≈øtian ≈øhould take away any of the ≈øame.

            <p>In the meane time, while≈øt the Officers were taking the≈øe couragious Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pions out of the fore≈øaid mi≈øerable dungeon, to be conueyed to the place of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, the Gouernour called for thirty men &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men al≈øo out of the pri≈øon of <hi>Nanga≈øachi,</hi> whome he determined to put to death togeather, with tho≈øe that were to come from <hi>Omura.</hi> And when he had giuen ≈øentence of death again≈øt them, commanding that the ≈øame ≈øhould be put in execution the next day, he ≈øent them backe againe vnto pri≈øon: who albeit they went chayned all togeather, like malefactours, worthy to dye for mo≈øt notorious crymes; yet they departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the Iudgment ≈øeat with great Ioy and Iubily of heart, euery one holding vp a Crucifix, or other Cro≈ø≈øe in his hand, as high as he could, in ≈øigne of Tryumph.</p>
            <p>The troupe of couragious Women marched fir≈øt; among≈øt whome one more eminent, as Captayne, went before the re≈øt, with a banner of Chri≈øt IESVS

            <p>After the women followed the vndaunted band of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, putting likewi≈øe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øelues in ≈øuch order of proce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, that affoarded a mo≈øt worthy &amp; plea≈øa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t ≈øhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eyes of God, &amp; to all the Chri≈øtians that beheld the ≈øame; who not contented with the only beholding therof, but inflamed with an holy emulation of their hapines, went al≈øo in great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>bers acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>panying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, &amp; following their ≈øteps with great reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce &amp; deuotion.</p>
            <p>Not long after this, entred into the Citty the fore≈øaid Pri≈øoners that were ≈øent for from <hi>Omura,</hi> in number fiue and twenty, among≈øt whome one and twenty were Religious men of diuers Orders: Whom when the Chri≈øtians of <hi>Nanga≈øachi</hi> beheld, what flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made they (thinke you) to come to ≈øee, and to ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute them?

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6944:7"/> fir≈øt of all infu≈øed into their ≈øoules? In the meane tyme, the ioyfull Fathers cea≈øed not to comfort their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted children, bidding them be of good comfort; &amp; encouraging them to put their tru≈øt in the Fatherly protection of Almighty God; a≈ø≈øuring them that his Infinite Goodnes would neuer let them want other Fathers and Mai≈øters to nouri≈øh, and increa≈øe their good de≈øires. And ≈øo finally exhorting, &amp; animating them to per≈øeuere con≈øtantly in the ≈øincere and true fayth of IESVS Chri≈øt, euen vntill death, they tooke their la≈øt farewells.</p>
            <p>Being now come vnto the place of execution, the Officers a≈ø≈øigned euery one a pillar or ≈øtake, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he was to be burned; which euery one of the holy Prie≈øts, before they were bound vnto them, falling downe vpon his knees, with great reuerence imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and ≈øaluted with a thou≈øand ki≈ø≈øes: The like al≈øo did the lay Religious Brothers, being moued therunto by the pious example of the Prie≈øts. The ≈øight wherof was a cau≈øe of great admiration to the Beholders, and ≈øtirred vp in the harts of many ≈øo great feeling of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, that they could not refraine from teares.</p>
            <p>In this meane tyme, while≈øt tho≈øe thirty pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which (as before we recounted) had bene ≈øent backe with their ≈øentence of death to the pri≈øon, in the ≈øame Citty, were coming towards the ≈øame place of execution; the officers were bu≈øied in binding to their ≈øeuerall pillars the fiue and twenty before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, all whome they bound but very loo≈øely in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der following.</p>
            <p>Vnto the foure fir≈øt pillars were bound foure Men,

            </p>
            <p>After Father <hi>Spinola,</hi> followed the Reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d Fa. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus Ferrerius</hi> of the order of <hi>S.

Then followed Father <hi>Seba≈øtian Quimura</hi> of the Society of IESVS, a Cittizen of <hi>Firandum</hi> borne in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponia,</hi> who had liued there thirty yeares in the Society of IESVS, of which he had bene Prie≈øt for the ≈øpace of twenty; being him≈øelf the fir≈øt <hi>Iaponian</hi> that euer tooke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> him the holy Order of Prie≈øthood, wherin he ≈øhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him≈øelfe a mo≈øt worthy labourer in the vineyard of his Country, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> endowed with ≈øingular Vertues, and an excellent Preacher in the Iaponian language.</p>
            <p>Then followed the Reuerend Father <hi>Peter de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uila</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:6944:8"/> of the order of <hi>S. Francis;</hi> Father <hi>Richard de S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> of the ≈øame Order; Father <hi>Alfon≈øus de Mena</hi> of the order of <hi>S. Dominicke;</hi> Father <hi>Francis de Morales</hi> of the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>They that were not Prie≈øts, were placed in this order: <hi>Vincentius,</hi> a Religious Brother of the order of <hi>Saint Francis</hi> borne in <hi>Europe: Anthony Fugia</hi> a Iapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, of the Society of IESVS: <hi>Gon≈øaluus Fu≈øay</hi> of the ≈øame Society and Countrey: <hi>Petrus Zampo</hi> of the ≈øame both religion and Countrey: <hi>Michael Iaponen≈øis</hi> of the ≈øame Order. After the≈øe againe followed foure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the order of <hi>S.

            <p>So as to reckon them ouer againe there were of ≈øecular men Foure, that were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>demned for receiuing of the Religious Fathers into their hou≈øes, Nine reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men of the order of <hi>S. Dominicke,</hi> Three of Saint Francis, and Nine of the Society of IESVS, all which being put together, do make the full number of fiue and twenty Crowned-Martyrs. The Executioners had ≈øcarce made an end of placing and binding the≈øe vnto their pillars, when behold that other new troupe of thirty glorious Confe≈ø≈øours which were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be beheaded, were brought to the ≈øame place, who as ≈øoone as they ≈øaw the religious men, they fell
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6944:8"/> ≈øodainly to imbracing, and ≈øaluting them with many teares and ≈øighes.</p>
            <p>Among≈øt the re≈øt, a certaine Matrone called <hi>I≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella Fernandez,</hi> came running to the pillar wherunto Father <hi>Charles Spinola</hi> was bound, to giue him the la≈øt farewell. She was the wydow of a mo≈øt noble Martyr who for hauing entertained the ≈øaid Father in his hou≈øe had vnder gone a glorious death. She had a little child called <hi>Ignatius,</hi> ≈øcarce fiue yeares old, whom ≈øhe mo≈øt deerely and tenderly loued. When ≈øhe was euen now ready to lay hold vpon the pillar, and Father <hi>Charles</hi> ready to ≈øalute her, he cryed out vnto her, <hi>√¥ I≈øabella, I≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella, vbi e≈øt tuus Ignatiolus? vbi est? vbi e≈øt, inquam, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liolus tuus?</hi> Where is your little <hi>Ignatius?</hi> where is, I ≈øay, your little Sonne? <hi>I≈øabella</hi> hearing this, as ≈øhe had her hart all inflamed and ≈øet on fire, and to the end ≈øhe might make an≈øwere no le≈ø≈øe by deedes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> by words, made no more a doe, but ≈øtraight fetching forth her little One from among≈øt the throng of people, tooke him in her armes, and lifting him vp towards Heauen, pre≈øented him before the Father, ≈øaying: Behold heere (my deare≈øt Father) behold my little Sonne; behold heere I bring you my little <hi>Ignatius;</hi> I offer you my little ≈øonne, that he may be ≈øacrificed vnto God, and become a martyr, togeather with his mother, in this your Company.</p>
            <p>When Father <hi>Charles</hi> ≈øaw, and heard the Mother vtter ≈øuch re≈øolute ≈øpeaches, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>cerning her little ≈øo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ne, it is incredible what comfort, and ≈øpirituall ioy he conceiued in his ≈øoule.</p>
            <p>Now approached the happy houre ≈øo much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6944:9"/> for of all this couragious Troupe: now was the fuell all ≈øet ready round about the pillars; but before the fire was put vnto it, the Executioners, with mo≈øt barbarous cruelty, cut off the heads of tho≈øe thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men and women, as al≈øo of twelue young children, the elde≈øt whereof was not yet full ten yeares old. And when it was demanded of them, Why they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed the≈øe before they had burned the others, that came fir≈øt to the ≈øtake? They an≈øwered, they did it, to terrify and di≈øanimate them, that they might haue little courage to vndergoe the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t of the fire. And to the end they might better accompli≈øh what they did pretend, they tooke vp the heads of tho≈øe whome they had ≈ølaine, yet warme, and all-imbrued with their owne innocent bloud, and bowled, &amp; tumbled them vp and downe before their eyes.</p>
            <p>But when they ≈øaw that the holy Confe≈ø≈øours could not be daunted, or di≈øcomfited with this, they kindled the fire. The fuell now, which on euery ≈øide enuironed the fiue and twenty Holy Martyrs, began indeed to flame, and burne vehemently: But (as many with particuler diligence ob≈øerued) there was a great ≈øpace left betwixt the fire, and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men; and as ≈øome, that were more curious then others, and tooke the mea≈øure of it, ≈øay it was no le≈ø≈øe then three yards di≈øtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> them on euery ≈øide. And this was al≈øo done of ≈øet purpo≈øe, that they might be tormented &amp; con≈øumed by little and little, with a ≈ølow &amp; lingring fire; and therfore the Officers were ≈øtill ready at hand to quench the flame when it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned too fa≈øt, for feare of di≈øpatching them too ≈øoone.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:6944:9"/>
            <p>But for what end did they this? For no other ≈øurely, but that ≈øuch as would for≈øake their faith, and woor≈øhip their fal≈øe Gods, might the more ea≈øily e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. And for this purpo≈øe al≈øo they left their bands ≈øo ≈ølacke, that they might them≈øelues ea≈øily vntye the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, and he that would yeild to the Pre≈øidents offer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, might therby ≈øaue his life. And for the ≈øame cau≈øe likewi≈øe they ≈øet the gate of the place of Executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> wide open, that who≈øoeuer would, might ca≈øt downe his crowne of Martyrdome, and e≈øcape both fire and ≈øword.</p>
            <p>But there was not found one among≈øt all the≈øe Glorious Confe≈ø≈øours, who did not in the very mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øt of the ≈øcorching flames reioyce and triumph in our Lord: Who did not fixe his eyes vpon Heauen, with all hope and confidence in God: and who did not finally indure the burning fire with a quiet and cheerfull heart, and with his whole body ≈øo immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable,

            <p>One thing there was, that among≈øt the re≈øt, was a chiefe and ≈øpeciall cau≈øe of the great courage and con≈øtancy of the≈øe noble Champions, I meane the ≈øo extraordinary and great concour≈øe of Chri≈øtians that were pre≈øent, which could not choo≈øe but be ≈øo much the greater, by how much they had notice of the time &amp; place long before, by meanes a≈øwell of the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as al≈øo in regard of the de≈øire they had to ≈øee ≈øo many famous Religious men, both of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponia,</hi> and ≈øuch venerable Prie≈øts, who had ≈øo long laboured and taken paines in the Vineyard of <hi>Iaponia,</hi> ≈øome for twenty, ≈øome for twenty fiue, yea and ≈øome for whole thirty yeares togeather.</p>
            <p>But that we may make ≈øome ghe≈ø≈øe at the number of the ≈øpectatours, it will not be ami≈ø≈øe to call to mind what Father <hi>Iohn Baptista de Baeza</hi> of the Society of IESVS, Rectour of <hi>Nanga≈øachi,</hi> who hath dwelt in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponia</hi> now full foure and thirty yeares, doth te≈øtify in

            <p>The fire was no ≈øooner out, but the Chri≈øtians in≈øtantly with great violence brake into the place of Execution, to reuerence and gather vp the ≈øacred Reliques.

            <p>The Pre≈øident therfore commanded a huge deepe pit to be made in the ground, and in the ≈øame a very great fire of wood, and all the bodies of the ble≈ø≈øed Martyrs, togeather with the pillars and ≈øtakes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they had byn tyed, to be ca≈øt into the ≈øame, and there burnt to a≈øhes, and la≈øtly all the a≈øhes very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put in ≈øackes to be carryed in ≈øhips farre out of the ≈øight of <hi>Nanga≈øachi,</hi> and there to be ≈øcattered,

            <p>The day next en≈øuing after this mo≈øt illu≈øtrious Martyrdome, which was the eleauenth of September, was beheaded <hi>M.

            <p>Another Chri≈øtian al≈øo as he was gathering vp ≈øome ≈ømall Reliques or a≈øhes of the ≈øacred bodyes of the burned Martyrs, which were kept with watch &amp; ward, within the for≈øaid place of Execution, was in the night apprehended, and brought before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour; Who when he vnder≈øtood that he was a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of <hi>Omura,</hi> ≈øent him thither pre≈øently as pri≈øoner, where the Gouernour of that Citty, as ≈øoone as he arriued, put both him, and all his family to death; and ≈øo for the fayth of Chri≈øt they all obtayned a crowne of Martyrdome.</p>
            <p>The twelfth day of September there was at <hi>Omu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> a famous Martyrdome of the R.

Francis;</hi> and al≈øo of diuers other Iaponians, who were all con≈øumed by fire, for the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6944:11"/> fayth and loue of IESVS Chri≈øt. Among≈øt the≈øe was a certaine Woman who≈øe admirable piety and deuotion de≈øerueth euerla≈øting memory: for that after ≈øhe had beene found by the Officers among≈øt the ≈øacred Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of the fornamed holy Martyrs, and had already giuen ≈øufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t te≈øtimony, both by praying &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her ≈øelfe to their merits, what ≈øhe was; being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what ≈øhe was doyng, &amp; whether ≈øhe were a Chri≈øtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, or no, an≈øwered very couragiou≈øly, that they might ea≈øily ≈øee, if they had eyes, by what ≈øhe did, that ≈øhe was a Chri≈øtian. And what, (≈øaid ≈øhe) will you haue any thing el≈øe with me? For this her re≈øolute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere they made no more a doe, but in≈øtantly in the ≈øame place cut off her head, and ca≈øt her body vpon the heape of the re≈øt of the Martyrs, which together with hers, do in all make the number of fifteene more.</p>
            <p>Ten other holy Martyrs al≈øo, togeather with <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu≈øtine Onda</hi> of the Society of IESVS, who were all companions to Father <hi>Camillus Constantius</hi> of the ≈øame Society, were put to death at <hi>Yquinotima,</hi> a Towne of <hi>Iaponia</hi> nere vnto <hi>Firandum,</hi> for the fayth of Chri≈øt, being all burned aliue, and con≈øumed to a≈øhes.</p>
            <p>But the happy death of Father <hi>Camillus</hi> fell vpon the fifteenth day of September at <hi>Firandum,</hi> who there obteined a Crowne of Glory, ending the cour≈øe of his Martyrdome by fire: where the concour≈øe of people was exceeding great, by rea≈øon that there were then lying in the Hauen at anker by <hi>Firandum,</hi> thirteene Engli≈øh and Holland ≈øhips well fraught with mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and con≈øequently no ≈ømall ≈øtore of pa≈ø≈øengers, Marriners, ≈øouldiers, factours, and the like, that came
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6944:12"/> to ≈øee this ≈øaid ≈øpectacle. Father <hi>Camillus</hi> was an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> borne in <hi>Romagnia,</hi> who could ≈øpeake the Flemi≈øh tongue well, and diuers other languages be≈øides. He was a man of an Apo≈øtolicall ≈øpirit, of which he gaue ≈øufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t te≈øtimony by preaching in diuers Countries, wherby he greatly moued the peoples hearts, a≈øwell by rea≈øon of his rare Eloquence, as of the vehement feruour of his deuotion. In this Amphitheater where he was to be con≈øumed by fire, from out the pile of wood, as from ≈øome chaire or pulpit, he made a ≈øpeach vnto all the ≈øpectatours. But the Epilogue, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion therof he conuerted vnto the <hi>Iaponians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues alone, of who≈øe cu≈øtomes and ceremonies he had got no ≈ømall knowledge: in which he mo≈øt effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciou≈øly proued, and concluded, that the fayth of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS Chri≈øt was both true, nece≈ø≈øary, and ≈øecure. And whil≈øt be ≈øpake thus, he did ≈øo raui≈øh the <hi>Iaponians</hi> hearts with the ≈øweet harmony of his Eloquence, that they would not ≈øuffer the fire to be kindled ≈øo ≈øoone, as otherwi≈øe it ≈øhould haue byn, that they might not be ≈øo ≈øoone depriued of that ≈øweet fruite of his diuine ≈øpeach. Neyther was the heat of the fire able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that heat of Charity which burned within his bre≈øt. For euen after that the wood was all ≈øet on fire round about him, he ≈øtill ca≈øt out fiery words on euery ≈øide vnto all the beholders, and could neuer make an end of ≈øpeaking, vntill he made an end of liuing.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond day of October, Nine other noble Martyrs illu≈øtrated the Citty of <hi>Nanga≈øachi</hi> with their glorious deathes, wherof three little children died ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for the fayth of Chri≈øt. But that which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6944:12"/> to one of the nine is admirable to recount: For being in mo≈øt cruell manner tortured for the ≈øpace of ≈øeauen dayes vpon the Racke, becau≈øe he refu≈øed to betray, and di≈øcouer certaine Religious men: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding all their racking, they were not able to wre≈øt from him any other words then <hi>Ie≈øus Maria, O Ie≈øus Maria! O what an ardent and burning de≈øire haue I to enter into the Glory of my Ie≈øus!</hi> with ≈øuch other like exclamations. So as the Executioners now perceiuing on the one ≈øide, that they laboured in vaine, and on the other ≈øide, being a≈øhamed to acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues to be ouercome by a Chri≈øtian, they opened (O mo≈øt barbarous or rather inhumane cruelty!) they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, I ≈øay, a hole in the fle≈øh of his ≈øhoulder, and therin poured boyling lead: Notwith≈øtanding all this, the valiant Champion of IESVS Chri≈øt remained ≈øtill ≈øo inuincible, that the Executioners quite de≈øpayring of the victory, with all rage and fury ca≈øt him, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther withall his family, into the fire, and when there was nothing el≈øe of them left but a≈øhes, they gathered them vp, and threw it into the ≈øea.</p>
            <p>The 23. of September fiue other Chri≈øtians did con≈øecrate their liues to God, for hauing entertained and hidden in their hou≈øes, the holy Martyr, Father <hi>Hyacinthus</hi> a Religious man of the Order of <hi>S. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke,</hi> wherof three, to wit, the husband, his wife, and their Child, were burned, and the other two behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>The 27. day of May, fower miles from <hi>Firan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi> two other Chri≈øtians were put to death for the loue of IESVS Chri≈øt; the one for hauing lodged Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <hi>Camillus</hi> in his hou≈øe, the other for hauing carryed him in his Barke to diuers places, to and fro, to preach the holy Gho≈øpell of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>Not long after this, happened a mo≈øt rare Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome of a very Venerable man of foure≈øcore and fiue yeares old. This man was ca≈øt headlong into the ≈øea, hauing tyed vnto his feet two ≈øo huge great ≈øtones, that one of them would haue bene inough to load foure lu≈øty ≈øtrong fellowes; who in≈øtantly, and as it were in the twinckling of an eye ≈øunke downe to the very bottome: but behold a very ≈øtrang thing, as if both he, and the two great ≈øtones al≈øo had beene made of the lighte≈øt Corke, he came gliding vp againe to the very top, where ≈øwimming aboue the water, like the ≈øwan he began to ≈øing before his death, and with a mo≈øt ≈øweet &amp; plea≈øant voice, he repeated thrice this mellifluous ditty <hi>Ie≈øus Maria, Ie≈øus Maria, Ie≈øus Maria,</hi> and then by the weight of the ≈øtoones being drawne downe againe into the ≈øea, neuer appeared more.</p>
            <p>This Miraculous ≈øight and Martyrdome fell v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the 2. of Iune, to the great admiration of all the beholders, and particular ioy and comfort of innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Chri≈øtians, that were pre≈øent, and did ≈øee the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>Vpon the next day after, which was the 3. of Iune another Chri≈øtian man, and companion of Father <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus Constantius</hi> of the Society of IESVS, was likewi≈øe put to death, for hauing a≈ø≈øi≈øted him in Eccle≈øia≈øtical functions and mini≈øteries. And vpon the 8. day of the ≈øame Moneth, another al≈øo ≈øuffered death, for the ≈øame cau≈øe.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:6944:13"/>
            <p>Vpon the 28, of Iuly were three other Chri≈øtians, put to death, for a very ≈øtrange cau≈øe: for that (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øooth) they would not lend their hor≈øes to carry the holy Martyrs to execution; for indeed the Chri≈øtians did piou≈øly belieue, and per≈øuade them≈øelues, that it was a ≈øinne for any of them, ≈øo lend his hor≈øe to help forward the execution of ≈øo barbarous a Cruelty.</p>
            <p>Two others al≈øo, that were Twinnes by birth, were put to a cruell Martyrdome, only for animating and encouraging of other Martyrs, that were ≈øtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hand to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d with death in a grieuous agony. And another likewi≈øe, in another place, was crowned with Martyrdome for refu≈øing to lend his hor≈øe to carry the Martyrs to their death.</p>
            <p>Neyther is he to be pa≈ø≈øed ouer with ≈øilence, who though his Name, and the manner of his Martyrdome in particuler be not knowne, yet was he put to death for the fayth of Chri≈øt in the Suburbes of a little town neere vnto <hi>Firandum,</hi> where certaine Husbandmen haue a few cottages for their habitation.</p>

Ignatius,</hi> which God Almighty hath made the meanes of ≈øo many, and ≈øo wonderfull miracles, ≈øome ≈øixteene yeares ≈øince was, by <hi>Don Rocque de Villar</hi> Chanon of <hi>Calatayude,</hi> fir≈øt ≈øet vp in the Sacri≈øty, or Ve≈øtry of the Pari≈øh Church of <hi>Munebrega,</hi> togeather with other Founders of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g≈øt the pictures of diuers Cardinals, Archbi≈øhops, Bi≈øhops, Mai≈øters of the Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Malta,</hi> Vicechancellours, Iu≈øtices, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors of E≈øtate, Iudges of his Catholike Maie≈øty, and of other worthy and famous Per≈øons, which had bene ≈øometimes promoted from this place to the≈øe dignities;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6944:23"/> and being compared with many other pictures of the ≈øame Saint, ≈øeemeth to differ from them all, as ≈øhewing, ≈øomewhat ≈øuperiour, and extraordinary, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie≈øty it carrieth in the Face.</p>
            <p>Vpon the fir≈øt Friday, after it was placed vpon the Altar, being the 21. day of Aprill, hauing bene kept alwayes before in a dry place, it began to ≈øweat on the right ≈øide vnder the arme, and ≈øo continued for the ≈øpace of 4. howers; which ≈øweat was an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind of liquor, much differing from water, although it ≈øeemed ≈øo in colour, as al≈øo from oyle, or any other running liquor; but it came out ≈øwelling, like certaine full &amp; thicke drops; and as fa≈øt as it was dryed vp, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently the ≈øame liquor began to flow out againe; all which was gathered, and drunke vp with two great linnen Towlls, and is yet there kept.</p>
            <p>Vpon Friday al≈øo a fortnight after, being the 5. of <hi>May,</hi> the ≈øame ≈øweat began againe to flow forth, for the ≈øpace of two houres. Witne≈ø≈øes of the≈øe ≈øweatings were many Eccle≈øia≈øticall, and Religious per≈øons, who ≈øaw them, &amp; the R. Father <hi>Friar Peter Villar</hi> of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>S. Augu≈øtine,</hi> and Bachelour of Diuinity, did wet two handkerchers therwith, which are kept vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this day.</p>
            <p>Some few dayes after, a certaine woman of the towne of <hi>Alarua,</hi> hauing heard of the miracles of <hi>S. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> out of a de≈øire to find remedy again≈øt a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous great ≈øwelling which ≈øhe had in her bre≈øts, to her extreme griefe and payne; came to <hi>Munebrega</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mending her ≈øelfe deuoutly to the Saint, in his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, pre≈øently ≈øhe felt certaine drops of water to run
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6944:24"/> downe her brea≈øt, as if it had bene ≈øome ≈øweat of that ≈øwelling, which much ea≈øed her paine, and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow le≈ø≈øe. Vpon this, one of the Towells wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ≈øweat afore≈øaid of the Picture had byn dryed vp, was applyed vnto her bre≈øt, and the ≈øwelling pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently re≈øolued it ≈øelfe into great aboundance of water, &amp; by and by after the woman remained wholy cured.</p>
            <p>Many other famous miracles haue bene wrought there, by the Merits and Interce≈ø≈øion of <hi>S. Ignatius,</hi> which do exceed the number of an hundred; all which haue byn wrought within the ≈øpace of one month, and are mo≈øt notorious to all the Inhabitants therabout. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt which, be≈øides tho≈øe aboue mentioned, there haue byne foure blind re≈øtored to their ≈øight, many Cripples, many deafe, and many ≈øicke of diuers infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mityes perfectly cured. So that it would be ouer long to recount them all heere in this briefe Relation, ≈øince there ≈øcarce pa≈ø≈øeth any day, wherin ≈øome one miracle or other is not wrought, and ≈øome dayes three or foure. Therfore it is no meruaile if vpon the certaine fame of ≈øo many, and continuall miracles, there be ≈øo great concour≈øe of people, from all parts of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of <hi>Spaine,</hi> vnto this Chappell of <hi>S. Ignatius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Al≈øo many Cittyes, Townes, and Villages do daily repaire thither in ≈øolemne Proce≈ø≈øion; in ≈øo much that continually the Church of <hi>Munebrega</hi> is full of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, ≈øome blind, ≈øome lame, ≈øome with vlcers, others with other di≈øea≈øes, who daily through the merits and interce≈ø≈øion of this glorious Saint do receiue health, and mo≈øt ≈øingular fauours at the hands of God. And if the Church of <hi>Munebrega</hi> were ≈øix times larger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> it is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6944:24"/> (and it is of a rea≈øonable good bignes:) yet would it be too little for all commers, who ≈øtriue to be there early in the morning, yea, and many tymes remayne there all night, to occupy, and preuent the getting of a good and commodious place.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, it is iudged for a thing certaine, that there is no one holy Place or Pilgrimage throughout all <hi>Spaine,</hi> more frequented at this day, then is the for≈øaid Chappell of Saint Ignatius in <hi>Munebrega.</hi> Wherfore the ≈øayd towne of <hi>Munebrega</hi> hath cho≈øen this Saint Ignatius, for their ≈øpeciall Patron, and vowed to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate his fea≈øt yearely with all ≈øolemnity po≈ø≈øible. Al≈øo in <hi>Maluenda, Villaroy,</hi> and other places within the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, and Territoryes of <hi>Calatayude,</hi> they haue lately dedicated diuers Chappells and Altars vnto <hi>S. Ignatius</hi> of Loyola, Founder of the Society of IESVS.</p>
            <p>That which mo≈øt of all ought to be pondered, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this famous place of Pilgrimage, is the great fruite, and the notable conuer≈øions of many lo≈øt and damnable ≈øoules, which vpon this occa≈øion hath byn wrought by generall Confe≈ø≈øions; be≈øides the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full changes in many from mo≈øt wicked and de≈øperate, vnto vertuous and godly liues. And without all doubt, this is that, which principally <hi>S. Ignatius</hi> pretendeth by the working of ≈øo great Miracles. For although in his life tyme, he alwayes exerci≈øed him≈øelfe in Corporall workes of Mercy; yet principally did he practi≈øe the Spirituall, with all po≈ø≈øible endeauour, as mo≈øt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and plea≈øing to the diuine Goodnes.</p>
